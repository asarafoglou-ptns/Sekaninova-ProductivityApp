Description: ProductivityApp allows you to generate a to-do list based on the characteristics of your tasks and your to-do list preferences. You can also use it to visualize your tasks with the so-called Eisenhower matrix that evaluates tasks based on importance and urgency. Lastly, you can use Pomodoro technique to track the time you spend on individual tasks and generate a Productivity report once you complete your tasks.
